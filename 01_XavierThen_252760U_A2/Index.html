                Welcome to our website! Here, you'll learn all about computers — <br>
                powerful electronic devices that help us perform a variety of tasks, from browsing the internet to
                running complex software.<br>
                A computer is made up of several important parts that work together. <br>
                The CPU (Central Processing Unit) acts as the brain, processing all instructions.<br>
                The RAM (Random Access Memory) temporarily stores data to help the computer run smoothly and
                quickly.<br>
                Files and programs are kept on long-term storage like a hard drive or SSD. <br>
                These components are all connected through the motherboard, and users interact with the system using
                devices like a keyboard, mouse, and monitor.<br>
                Explore our site to discover more about how these parts work together to make modern computing possible!

            <h1>What are computers?</h1>

            <p class="overview_para">
                Computers are an escential part of everyone's daily lives. The first "modern" programmable computer, the
                Zuse Z3, was invented in 1941 by Konrad Zuse in Germany.<br>
                However, the concept of a programmable computer dates back to the mid-1800s with Charles Babbage's
                Analytical Engine, though it was never built during his lifetime.
                <br>The first every 'computer', the Charles Babbage's Analytical Engine conceived by Babbage and is
                considered the first general-purpose computer concept.<br>
                It included features like an arithmetic logic unit (ALU), memory, and the use of punch cards for input,
                which were inspired by the Jacquard Loom.<br>
                However, it was never fully built during Babbage's lifetime due to technological limitations of the
                time.

            <h1>How were these computers used?</h1>

            <p class="overview_para">
                Early computers, from manual calculation tools like the abacus to the first electronic machines, were
                primarily used for scientific and military calculations,
                such as ballistics and code-breaking.<br>
                Early examples of computers used in code breaking include the Colossus. <br>
                The first large-scale electronic computer, which went into operation in 1944 at Britain's wartime
                code-breaking headquarters at Bletchley Park.

            <h1>How have these computer's evolved from the past?</h1>

            <p class="overview_para">
                Computers have evoled in multiple ways. The most noticable, is the size. Old computers used to be the
                size of literal rooms.<br>
                The Charles Babbage's Analytical Engine for example, was 4 meters tall and 8 meters tall. Meanwhile, the
                modern day computer is averaging 40 centimetres wide!.<br>
                This is with the main producer of such computers being Lenovo, Apple, Acer and ASUS.

            <h1>Individual computer parts.</h1>

            <h2>Now that you've learnt about the general history of the computer, let's learn how they operate!</h2>

            <h3>The Central Processing Unit (CPU)</h3>

            <p class="content_para">
                Starting off, we have the Central Processing Unit (CPU). The CPU is the Part of the computer that
                processes
                data and follows instructions. <br>It is usually a complex circuit
                made of many components that is compressed into a
                square or rectangular package. <br>The main function of the CPU is to Processes data and follows
                instructions; consists of an
                <span class="blue-text">Arithmetic Logic Unit</span> and a <span class="blue-text">control unit</span>.
                <br> When we say that a processor runs or executes
                instructions, it
                means that the processor follows
                or performs instructions.<br> A series of instructions is called a program, or simply software.
            </p>

            <img class="content_image" src="images/image_CPU.jpg" alt="CPU" title="CPU">

            <h3>The Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)</h3>

            <p class="content_para">
                The arithmetic logic unit (ALU) is apart of the CPU and it processes
                data by performing basic mathematical and
                logical operations such as addition,
                subtraction, multiplication and division.
                This unit performs the actual work of
                performing calculations and transforming data. <br>Think of the ALU as a calculator built into the brain
                of
                the computer. <br> When the CPU wants to do math or comparisons, it sends the job to the ALU. <br>
                The ALU quickly solves it and hands back the answer. Find out more in the link below.
            </p>

                target="_blank">The arithmetic
                logic unit (ALU)</a>

            <h3>The Control Unit</h3>

            <p class="content_para">
                The control unit follows instructions and
                decides when data should be stored, received
                or transmitted by different parts of the
                computer (including the ALU). <br>This unit makes
                sure that data is transported to where it
                needs to be, and that it is processed in the
                correct order.<br> The Control Unit is like a traffic cop or orchestra conductor inside the CPU. It
                doesn't
                do the math itself — <br>instead, it tells all the parts what to do, when to do it, and where to send
                the
                results.<br> It keeps everything moving in the right order. Find out more in the link below.

                Control unit</a>

            <h3>Extra knowledge on processors</h3>

            <p class="content_para">
                Often, a processor's speed is described by the number of instructions that the processor can
                perform in one second.<br> For instance, a 1 MHz (megahertz) processor can perform one million
                instructions per second <br>while a 1 GHz (gigahertz) processor can perform one billion instructions
                per second. <br> In general, the larger the number and unit, the faster and more powerful the processor.
                <br>
                There are also “multi-core” processors that contain multiple processing units inside a single
                package.<br> For instance, a “dual-core” package has two such processing units while a “quad-core”
                package has four.<br> These “multi-core” processors can perform more than one instruction at the
                same time, and thus are more powerful than “single-core” processors.
            </p>

            <h3>Computer Memory</h3>

            <p class="content_para">
                Whenever a computer needs to store data, it uses
                memory. <br>Physically, memory can exist in many
                forms, but in general, it is made up of many switches
                arranged in a fixed order.<br> Each switch can store one
                bit of data based on whether it is ON or OFF (i.e.
                ON = 1, OFF = 0).<br>
                Usually, the position of each byte is represented by a number called an address.<br>
                This is a number that allows a computer to quickly find those switches again if it needs to read or
                change the
                data that is stored.<br>
                This is similar to how a unit number is used to identify the location of each
                residence in an HDB block. <br>
                There are several types of memory in a computer such as, <span class="blue-text">Processor
                    registers</span>, <span class="blue-text">Random access memory (RAM)</span> and <span
                    class="blue-text">Read-only memory (ROM).</span>
            </p>

            <h3>Processor registers</h3>

            <p class="content_para">
                Processor registers are physically located inside
                the processor. <br>These extremely fast but small data
                storage spaces are used directly by the ALU and
                control unit. <br>The number and size of processor
                registers cannot be changed without changing
                the processor. Find out more in the link below.
            </p>

            <a class="content_link" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Processor_register"
                target="_blank">Processor registers </a>

            <h3>Random access memory (RAM)</h3>

            <p class="content_para">
                Random access memory (RAM) or main memory
                is where data and instructions are stored
                temporarily so that<br> they can be quickly accessed
                by the processor when needed. <br>For instance,
                when an application is started, its instructions may be loaded into RAM. <br>
                Data stored on RAM can be easily changed and is also <span class="blue-text">volatile</span>, which
                means that it is
                lost once the power
                supply to the computer is interrupted.
            </p>

            <img class="content_image" src="images/image_RAM.jpg" alt="Memory" title="Memory">

            <h3>Read-only memory (ROM)</h3>

            <p class="content_para">
                When we use the word “memory”, we are usually referring to RAM and not the other types
                of memory.<br> Most desktop computers have RAM located on removable cards so that the
                amount of RAM in the computer can be upgraded. <br>Other kinds of computers, however,
                may have only a fixed amount of RAM that cannot be changed.<br>Read-only memory (ROM) is where data and
                instructions that rarely need to change or
                would be needed for a computer to start up are stored. <br>Data stored on ROM cannot be
                easily changed and remains there regardless of whether the power supply is switched on
                or off. <br>This makes it ideal for storing instructions that are needed before data can be loaded
                into RAM.
            </p>

            <img class="content_image" src="images/image_ROM.jpg" alt="Read-only memory" title="Read-only memory">

            <h3>Storage mediums</h3>

            <p class="content_para">
                Secondary storage is where large amounts of data are stored, such as in a hard disk
                or hard drive. <br>Secondary storage is a way of storing large amounts of data that will not be lost
                when
                power supply
                is interrupted.<br> Compared to RAM, secondary storage is usually cheaper and able to store much
                more data.<br> It is also non-volatile, so the data that is stored
                remains there even without a power supply.
                <br>To avoid confusion, we typically use the word "<span class="blue-text">storage</span>" for this kind
                of
                storage space instead of the word "<span class="blue-text">memory</span>". <br>
                Different storage media are used for secondary
                storage.
            </p>

            <h3>The different kinds of storage medium</h3>

            <p class="content_para">
                There are three main types of storage mediums commonly used in computers: s (HDDs),
                solid-state drives (SSDs), and optical storage.<br> Hard drives store data on spinning magnetic disks
                and
                are known for offering large storage at a low cost,<br> though they are slower and more prone to
                damage.<br>
                SSDs, on the other hand, use flash memory with no moving parts, <br>making them much faster and more
                durable, but often more expensive per gigabyte. <br>Optical storage, such as CDs, DVDs, and Blu-rays,
                use
                lasers to read and write data on discs. <br> They are mostly used for media playback or backups, though
                they
                are slower and less common today.
            </p>

            <h3>Graphics Processing Unit</h3>

            <p class="content_para">
                A GPU, or Graphics Processing Unit, is a specialized electronic circuit that rapidly processes
                information, <br>primarily for graphics and video, but also for tasks like artificial intelligence and
                scientific computing.<br> GPUs are highly efficient at performing many calculations at once through a
                process called parallel processing,<br> making them ideal for data-intensive workloads that a central
                processing unit (CPU) might handle more slowly.
            </p>

            <h3>The Motherboard</h3>

            <p class="content_para">
                After learning about all the different components that make up a computer. You must be wondering how
                their combined. <br>
                Well, that all comes down to the motherboard. The motherboard is a simple board that combines all the
                above stated components.<br>
                This is done with the help of data buses, there are two types, <span class="blue-text">Data bus</span>
                and <span class="blue-text">Address bus</span>.<br>
                The data bus Transports data between memory and processor and is <span
                    class="blue-text">bi-directional</span>. <br>On the otherhand, the Address bus Transports required
                memory location from processor to
                memory and is <span class="blue-text">uni-directional</span>. <br>Furthermore, the motherboard 'talks'
                to the GPU and storage via special slots.<br>
                The GPU uses a PCIe slot for fast communication with the CPU. Storage devices like hard drives and SSDs
                use
                either SATA ports or M.2 slots.
